# Create a database called nutrition
create database nutrition;

# Use created nutrition database to import ALFAH and combined SNP data csv files into MySQL
use nutrition;

# Use Table Data wizard to import data
# 1) Open nutrition database using "schemas tab" (click on arrow next to it)
# 2) Right-click on "Tables" and select "Table Data Import Wizard"
# 3) Browse and select the alfah_data.csv (table1) and combined_snp_data.csv (table2) files (during seperate instances)
# 4) Click "open" and "next"
# 5) Select "Create new table", select nutrition database and name file
# 6) Check if imported columns will be in correct format once imported: check column names and suggested data types ("field types")
# 7) Select "next" to execute the data import

# Check variable names in each of the tables to be combined
describe table1;
describe table2;
show tables;

# Create new combined table (table3) and join table1 and table2 together based on "id" (shared variable)
# All columns from both tables will be combined
# Left join used to join relevant info in table2 to corresponding "id" in table1
# Note: "id" for table1 and "id2" for table2
create table table3
select * from table1 left join table2 on table1.id = table2.id2;

# Check that data from table1 and table2 were joined correctly in table3
describe table3;

# Visualise combined table
select * from table3;

# Export combined table data into csv file for further analysis
select * from table3 
into outfile 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/complete_dataset.csv'
