## Set up the working directory & load necessary packages
### Replace "C:/Users/file_location" with the location of the large text file
setwd("C:/Users/file_location")
library("conflicted")
library("tidyverse")

## Read the data text file (.txt file)
### Replace "file_name.txt" with the name of the large text file
### Note: All title headers were deleted in the text document before the text file was read
### Note: All hyphens ('-') were replaced with full stops ('.') before the text file was read
df1 <- read.tsv("file_name.txt", show_col_types = FALSE)
as_tibble(df1)

## Select only the columns you want using the names of the columns
### Note: column names, in this case, include the identifier column ('individual' column with the sample id) and the SNP names (e.g., snp1, snp2, snp3)
### Note: only the data from 3 snps were extracted at a time
df2 <- select(df1, column1, column2, column3)

## Write the specified columns to a .csv file
### Replace "new_file_name.csv" with the name of the created .csv file
write.csv(df2, "new_file_name.csv", row.names = FALSE)
